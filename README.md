Hello,tutor,I'm Li Shuoxue,a freshman from College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering(CCME).It's my first time to attend the class‘Introduction to Computing’,so I'll appreciate it if you give me a hand while I have difficulty in comprehending the computer languages and programming.And I greatly hope that it'll be a fantastic opportunity for me to adjust to the requirement of information society!
